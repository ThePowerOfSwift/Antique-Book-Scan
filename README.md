## Description

Antique Book Scan uses Optical Character Recognition technology to get the title of a book from a picture of its cover and outputs the price of the book in several online marketplaces for easy price comparison. 

Simply take a picture of a book cover or select from your image library. There are two OCR providers available: if the fast OCR option does not produce accurate results, simply select the slower yet much more accurate one.

## Installation

```ruby
pod install
```

...and then open the xcworkspace file.

## Usage

Select the OCR speed in the bottom right corner, then either take a picture with the camera or select one from your photo album.
